An MVP project following the Clean Architecture concepts to ensure the use of the best coding practices. Language: Kotlin.

Main Stack => Dagger-Android | RxJava2 | Retrofit | Room 

In this tag, you can access what I've complete after 4h of coding https://gitlab.com/haroldolivieri/ProductList/tags/4-hours-mark!

Below you can check the list of goals, nice to have and the following status of each one of them. 

>The not implemented features are those that I understand less priority in comparison with others (or for not having time enough). 
It is nothing about the level of difficulty.

### Goals

● Create an Android App, which fetches the content of a web service
(https://private-91dd6-iosassessment.apiary-mock.com/products).  ✅

● The products are shown in a scrolling list, sorted by name. ✅

● Each product contains a name, an image, the current price, the original price and its brand. All these information are shown inside the list. If the current price and original price are the same, only one of them is shown. ✅

● The list can be filtered by product name.❌

● The app is able to display the list offline, after the first run. ✅

● When you tap on a product, the image is displayed in full-screen mode.❌

● Write Unit Tests to test your code. ✅

### Nice to have

● The top bar disappears when the list is scrolled down, and reappear when scrolling up
again.✅

● Pull to refresh feature that reloads contents of the list from the web service✅

● Write a UI Test❌  

I'll be happy to explain all my architecture choices and receive feedback about my code.
Hope to hear from you soon!
